Tableaunoir enables you to export your board in PNG and PDF.

Tableaunoir exports your board as a strip.


## PDF document

Tableaunoir exports your board as a PDF document. There are two behaviors depending on your board is a classical one or a presentation with slides:
- The typical case is a classical board. Almost all boards are classical one. For instance, if you never edited the timeline and never added new slide, then your board is *classical*.  Technically, a board is classical when it ss made up of a single "slide".
- A presentation is a board which contains several slides. To make presentations, read [How to make presentations/animations](timeline.md).


### Classical board


Tableaunoir splits your board in "screen" or "window". Each window is a page in your PDF.

### Presentation

Tableaunoir makes a page for each slide.
