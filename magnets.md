# Magnets

Magnets are like fridge magnets that you can move on the blackboard.


## Predefined magnets

Tableaunoir offers a collection of predefined magnets. Go in the menu (Escape), tab "Magnets". Clicking on one of the buttons will insert some predefined magnets.

## Customized magnets

### Import an existing image

You can drag-n-drop any image file into Tableaunoir and it will become a magnet.

### Draw a magnet inside Tableaunoir

You can also draw a contour with your chalk and then press Ctrl+X or Ctrl+C to cut/copy the corresponding portion of the blackboard and transform it into a magnet.

### Draw on top of a magnet

You can draw on top of a magnet. To do so, the idea is to move the magnet in the background, behind the board. For that, place the mouse cursor on the magnet and press "b".
