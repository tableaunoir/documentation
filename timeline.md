# Make a presentation / animation

With Tableaunoir, you can create animated course / presentation. You can then:
- make presentations (by pressing PageDown and PageUp you will move in your slides)
- make animated GIFs (together with the software Peek for instance)
- make videos (together with the software OBS)

The presentation / animation mode is still in development. In case the timeline is not correctly displayed press "a" twice (once for hiding the timeline, and once for showing the timeline again).

## Example of an animated proof

Here is an example of a GIF:

Please also find an example of video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsBujkaOnr4]

## Animation mode!

Tableaunoir stores your course but also its evolution in the timeline. If you want all the states of your blackboard, click on the animation/replay button in the toolbar:

## Navigation in your course

Each little square at the bottom represents an atomic action (a drawing, erasing something, adding a magnet, deleting a magnet, moving a magnet, etc.). When you click on, you will reach the state of the board after that action. The first square on the left is the initial state of the board.

Small blue buttons ... and - enables to hide/show the squares on the timeline (otherwise the timeline would be very long).


## Editing

- Inserting new actions. Click on a square to reach the interested state you want to start with. Then just perform the action as usual (drawing, erasing).
- Delete an action. Drag and drop a square on the top to remove that action from the list. /!\ It can not be canceled!
- Change the order of actions. Drag and drop a square in another place to change the order. Soon, we will be able to move several actions.
- Make a keyframe (equivalent of `\pause` in LaTEX beamer): double-click on the square. The square becomes a keyframe. By double-clicking again, the square stops being a keyframe.
- you can select multiple actions with the help of Ctrl and Maj, to move several actions or delete several actions.
- for adding a new slide clicking by clearing all the board, go in the tool menu (pressing "t") and choose "Clear the board" (the icon is an eraser with a cape).
