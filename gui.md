- draw **freely** (the default mode of Tableaunoir)
- draw **lines**
- draw **rectangles**
- draw **ellipses**
- draw ellipses from **center**
- **compass**, in order to draw arcs. [How to use the compass?](compass.md)

From left to right:
- Go to the **previous slide** in your presentation
- Go to the **next slide** in your presentation
- Open the **menu** for **adding/merging slides**

Then each small square represents an action. The first clear square is the beginning of the slide. Each following square are the actions executed in the current slide. In the picture, they are drawing actions.
