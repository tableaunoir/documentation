From top to top (clockwise):
- the first button is cut around the last contour that was drawn. The icon of the button is a magnet because moveable objects on the board in Tableaunoir are **magnets**
- draw **freely** (the default mode of Tableaunoir)
- draw **lines**
- draw **rectangles**
- draw **ellipses**
- draw ellipses from **center**
- **compass**, in order to draw arcs
- **clear** the board (it also creates a new clear slide)
