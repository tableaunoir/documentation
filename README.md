## Philosophy of Tableaunoir (reasons why some features do not exist in Tableaunoir)

The main philosophy is KISS (keep it simple, stupid). That is why many usual features are not (and will not be) implemented in Tableaunoir. 
- In Tableaunoir, you cannot change the line width and the type of stroke. It is because this features are not very useful. Also, just do as if you use a pen on a paper, or a chalk on a real blackboard. To keep the user interface simple, it will probably never be implemented. Tableaunoir is *not* a drawing software, but a board to teach/share ideas.
- In Tableaunoir, you cannot zoom in/out (except having an overview of your full board). The reason is that it is not very useful to zoom in/out. Probably, you can explain your idea without zoom in/out.
- In Tableaunoir, you cannot scroll vertically and only horizontally. Some users may expect to have an infinite canvas in all directions. We think it is not a good idea because your board may lack of structure. Scrolling horizontally is just perfect because it allows you to have several panels in your board.
- You can change the font of texts etc. The user interface will remain simple to use.
- You cannot resize magnets (pictures) with the mouse. The reason is because we think magnets should be very easy to be moved. Displaying handles so that objects can be resized etc. will take space on the screen, will annoy the user when magnets are moved etc.

## Advanced features

Although it follows KISS, there are some advanced features. This repository contains some documentation and illustration in Tableaunoir.
